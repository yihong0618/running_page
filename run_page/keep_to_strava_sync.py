"""
Only provide the ability to sync data from Keep's multiple sport types to Strava's corresponding sport types to help those who use multiple devices like me, the web page presentation still uses Strava (or refer to nike_to_strava_sync.py to modify it to suit you).
My own best practices:
1. running/hiking/Cycling (Huawei/OPPO) -> Keep
2. Keep -> Strava (add this scripts to run_data_sync.yml)
3. Road Cycling(Garmin) -> Strava.
4. running_page(Strava)
